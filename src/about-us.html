        <h3>Overview on utilization</h3>
        <p>Womenâ€™s health and hygiene has been one of the key concerns over the years across the world. The awareness on menstrual hygiene and usage of sanitary napkins is virtually absent in rural areas. Poor menstrual hygiene can cause fungal infections,
            repeated infections to RTI, cervical cancer and vulnerable to infertility.</p>
        <p>The adolescent girls get information and education on menstruation from her mother and grandmother, who themselves had practiced the unhygienic behaviors for years and thus do not see any harm in the practices of using old cloths during menstruation.
            By creating enough awareness regarding menstrual hygiene's importance and use of sanitary napkins, we try to prevent such chronic diseases from happening in the rural areas</p>
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>Our Vision is to provide quality sanitary pads to serve the women's of rural and underprivileged communities</p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to create hygiene products that are good for the body, community and the environment in a sustainable and affordable way</p>
